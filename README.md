## About

Quarto is an open source STEM publishing system. Its origin is in the R
statistics language. Quarto produces documents in multiple formats,
including  HTML and PDF. It is based on Markdown. Via MathJax it has good
math support. It is a strong candidate for producing accessible
outputs, particularly for blind users. This is a Quarto website.

## Goals

The current intent is to focus on providing some examples of
accessible LaTeX help, andto provide some cheat sheets for blind students taking math modules. In these specialist areas, feedback from users is really
important to ensure accessibility and other user needs. This is
particularly important at the early stages of development.
