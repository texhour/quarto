## About

Quarto is an open source STEM publishing system. It origin is in the R
statistics language. Quarto produces documents in multiple formats,
include HTML and PDF. It is based on Markdown. Via MathJax it has good
math support. It is a strong candidate for producing accessible
outputs, particular for blind users. This is a Quarto website.

## Goals

The present intention is to focus on provide some examples of
accessible Latex help, and of cheat sheets for blind students taking a
math module. In these specialist areas, feedback from users is really
important to ensure accessibility and other user needs. This is
particularly important at the early stages.

## Guide

The first four pages are:

* The first page of an introduction to [Latex math](/tmp/latex-math-2023-10-17.qmd).
* Work in progress on special keys and the [Keyboard](/tmp/keyboard-2023-10-17.qmd).
* An exploratory page pre-calculus page on [Fractions](/tmp/fractions-2023-10-17.qmd).
* An exploratory page on [Venn diagrams](/tmp/venn-diagrams-2023-10-17.qmd).
* [NEW] An exploratory page on [Set theory](/tmp/set-theory-2023-10-19.qmd).
* [NEW: 2023-10-31] A college algebra [Cheat sheet](/tmp/cheat-sheet-2023-10-31.qmd).

## Feedback

Comments are welcome. Here are three good ways.

- Send a message to the [BlindMath mailing list](http://nfbnet.org/pipermail/blindmath_nfbnet.org/).
- Raise on issue on [the github project](https://github.com/texhour/quarto).
- Email the project owner `jfine2358 @ gmail dot com`.

The Blind Math list is a good resource for STEM accessibility (with a
focus on math). Do consider joining that list.
